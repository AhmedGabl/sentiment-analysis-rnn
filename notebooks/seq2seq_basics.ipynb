        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The encoder-decoder architecture is a powerful neural network design used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. It consists of two main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoder**: The encoder reads the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector.\n",
        "2. **Decoder**: The decoder uses the context vector to generate the output sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore the theory behind the encoder-decoder architecture and implement a simple sequence-to-sequence model using TensorFlow/Keras.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Understanding the Encoder-Decoder Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Encoder\n",
        "\n",
        "The encoder is typically a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). It processes the input sequence step by step and produces a context vector that summarizes the entire input sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a typical RNN, the hidden state at each time step `t` depends on the input at that time step and the previous hidden state:\n",
        "\\[ h_t = f(W \\cdot x_t + U \\cdot h_{t-1}) \\]\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- \\( x_t \\) is the input at time step `t`.\n",
        "- \\( h_t \\) is the hidden state at time step `t`.\n",
        "- \\( f \\) is an activation function (e.g., tanh or sigmoid).\n",
        "- \\( W \\) and \\( U \\) are learnable weight matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Decoder\n",
        "\n",
        "The decoder is another RNN that generates the output sequence from the context vector produced by the encoder. The decoder uses the context vector (or initial hidden state) to initialize its hidden state and then generates the output sequence, often in an autoregressive manner (where each output depends on the previous one).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Attention Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step of the output sequence generation. This mechanism helps the model handle long sequences by providing dynamic attention to relevant parts of the input during decoding.\n",

        "\n",
        "Delayed batching refers to the process of waiting for a specific number of data samples to be accumulated (batched) before performing a training step. This is often used to prevent memory overload or reduce unnecessary computations, especially when sequences vary in length. In seq2seq models, it helps manage varying input and output lengths more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why delay batching?**\n",
        "  - In tasks like machine translation, input sequences can vary greatly in length.\n",
        "  - Padding shorter sequences to match the longest one in a batch can lead to inefficient training (wasting computation on padded values).\n",

Seq2seq models are particularly useful for handling tasks where both the input and output are sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, text generation, and more. Below are several project ideas, along with a basic structure of how you would implement each one. I’ll also highlight the differences in each project to help you understand how the implementation of seq2seq varies.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Task Description:\n",
        "Translate sentences from one language to another. A seq2seq model is perfect for this task because the input and output are both sequences of words (or subword units).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Basic Structure:\n",
        "- **Encoder**: Processes the input sentence (in the source language).\n",
